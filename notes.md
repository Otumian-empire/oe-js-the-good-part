# OE-Javascript-The-Good-Part

Javascript is fun and all but it this and it is that. There is a good part of javascript which is even better than the whole part of javascript. This is awesome, we can use this small part ot write small, medium and even large scale projects and its still a javascript code. The DOM is so messy that javascript sadly takes the blame. Who isn't scared of duck typing or of a language that has o types? Guess what, javascript can be awesome and safe.

## white spaces

We can and should have or put a while space between a keyword and an identifier. So, `let x = 3` can be rewritten as `let x=3` and it will still work else, my browser indicated that this `letx=3`, works too,

Use the single line comment `//` over the multiline comment `/* */`. For all that we know, `//` comments all that comes after it on the same line. `/* */` comments out whatever is found within its body. So the commenting ends when javascript meets `*/` which is "closing tag" for the `/* */` commenting style. In a case we have a regular expression with `*/` then we are graced with a syntax error. The book used a simple example. Read the book if you want to know what kind of example it was.

## names

There a group of words that belongs to javascript and seriously, don't use them as identifiers in your programs. Your identifiers can start with either an `_` or a character then followed by a an `_`, a number or character of any number of sequence. Do not add white spaces to identifiers.

## numbers

`1` is a number and it is the same as `1.0`. Even though we call one an integer and the other a float/fraction. Do you remember anything about `1.0e0`? Well it's `1` or `1.0`. DO you get it? . They are numbers.

## String

`'bean', "pancake", "", "Git's blame is lit", "\"The dog spoke\", said the cat."` are all strings.

## statements

We can have `let var1 = val1;` or `let var1 = val1, var2 = val2, ...;`. How things are it's obvious code execution start from above, top to bottom. There are statements like `for`, `while`, `if`, `switch`, etc.

## expression

For starters `literals` are expressions, `variables`, built-in values like `true`, `false`, `NaN`, etc. There is an ternary option too which is of the form, `var = expression? [val|expression]:[val|expression];`. There are operators such as `. [] ( )`, `delete new typeof + - !`, `* / %`, `+ -`, `>= <= > <`, `=== !==`, `&&`, `||`, `?:`

## literals
Object literals are used to create
